Hi Sarah,

I toured a house today at 12 Harbour St, Sydney. It has 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms—seems perfect for us. The neighbourhood looks quiet and safe.

Love,
Adam

Hi Adam,

That sounds promising! Did you check how far it is from our offices? Also, are there good schools nearby? Three bedrooms is great, but I want to make sure it’s convenient for both our commutes and Mia’s school.

Love,
Sarah

Hey,

It’s about a 30-minute train ride to your office and 25 minutes for me by car. There’s a well-rated primary school two blocks away—Harbour Primary School. I’ll send you the listing so you can take a look.

Thanks! That’s actually really good for the both of us. I’ll review the listing tonight. If all looks good, maybe we can arrange an inspection together this weekend?

Sounds like a plan! I’ll schedule an inspection for Saturday morning.

See you at home,
